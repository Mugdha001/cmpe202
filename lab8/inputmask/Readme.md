# Design Pattern implemented - Decorator Pattern

Component interface has 2 operations:

CreditCardNumberdecorator()
CreditCardExpDecorator()..
The concrete Decorator class will implement these operations.

The already implemented classes CreditCardExp and CreditCardNum will extend these decorator methods.
